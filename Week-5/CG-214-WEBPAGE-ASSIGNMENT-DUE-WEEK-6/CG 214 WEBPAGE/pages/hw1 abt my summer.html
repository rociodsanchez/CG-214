            <p>Over the summer I went to France twice. I went to Dijon specifically both times and it's beautiful!</p>
            <p>Dijon is known for <a href="http://www.maille.com/">its mustard</a>, which I tried. It's delicious!</p>
        <div>I can't wait to go back soon after the semester ends.</div>
