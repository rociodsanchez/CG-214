Midterm Proposal

I will be dedicating my midterm to the jewelry industry of the USA, with some focus on New York City. I want to learn more about the industry I market for so that'd why I'd like to blog about it. 

The blog will include gifs and interactive content that is based on different kinds of jewelry made of different materials. I'll include iframes of maps from the places I visit, as well as videos and images of the jewelry I write about.
