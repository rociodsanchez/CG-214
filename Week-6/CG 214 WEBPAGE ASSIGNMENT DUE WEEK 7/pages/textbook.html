    <h3>Textbook notes</h3>
        <ul><li>Chapter 3, 4, 5 are on lists, links, and images, respectively. They're great reads! Chapter 8 goes over extra markup which includes iframes.</li>
            <ul><li>Chapter 3 - Lists, notes from <cite>HTML &amp; CSS DESIGN AND BUILD WEBSITES</cite></li>
                <blockquote>Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contractwhere each point needs to be identified by a section number.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order) </blockquote>
                <blockquote>Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.</blockquote>
                <ul><li>Attributes for lists are better edited in CSS</li>
                <li>&#60;dl&gt; are used for sets of terms with definitions</li>
                <li>&#60;dt&gt; holds the term name</li>
                <li>&#60;dd&gt; holds the defition!</li></ul>
<!-- I should also make a section or page for HTML/CSS/JS definitions and use the dl tags! -->
            </ul>
            <ul><li>Chapter 4 - Links</li>
                <ul><li>In this chapter I learned how to link to other pages and to sections within my own page using the id attribute!</li></ul>
            </ul>
            <ul><li>Chapter 5 - Images</li>

        <h3>Textbook notes</h3>
            <ul><li>Understanding structure</li>
                <ul><li>Attributes are composed of attribute names (like color, width, height, etc.) and attribute values (like 25px, 10%, etc.) Wrie names in lowercase.</li>
                <li>Everything writen between the title tags show up on the tab of the browser window. The body tags hold the content that will show in the main broswer</li></ul>
            <li>Learning about markup</li>
                <ul><li>The HyperText in HTML is the part of the language where you can add links that reference other pages</li>
                <li>The Markup part of HTML is what the tags do! Organize and structure your content</li>
                <li>The language is all of HTML!</li></ul>
            <li>Tags and Elements</li>
                <ul><li>Sometimes tags are refered to as elements</li></ul>

           <h3>Textbook notes</h3>
<!-- How to link local PDF files? -->
        <ul><li>More than just headings and paragraphs...</li>
            <ul><li><sub>Subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup> tags help out with writing dates and exponentiation</li>
            <li>If you thought &#60;br /&gt; was a cool, check out the &#60;hr /&gt; tag! (Used between weeks in this page)</li></ul>
        <li>Structural and semantic markup 
            <ul><li>Bold and italic tags are structural, emphasis tags are semantic (which provides extra information; suchas where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on)</li>
            <li>Other semantic tags include</li>
                <ul><li>&#60;strong&gt; comes up as bold text</li>
                <li>&#60;em&gt; comes up as italics</li>
                <li>&#60;blockquotes&gt; are used for long quotes, like how  I used it above for the w3schools quote</li>
                <li>&#60;q&gt; is used for shorter quotes and they input the <q></q> <!--""--> characters!</li>
                <li>The &#60;abbr&gt; tag shows abbreviation on a text when hovered over! For example: <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></li>
                <li>The &#60;address&gt; tag is used for the contact info of the writer of the page. Find mind before the closing body tag on this page!</li>
                <li>&#60;cite&gt; shows up as italics and is used when citing sources, like I did above for <cite>w3schools</cite></li>
                <li>&#60;dfn&gt; tags mark the defining instance of a term</li>
                <li>Then there's the <ins>&#60;ins&gt;</ins> tag and the <del>&#60;del&gt;</del> tag!</li> These are used for editing content.
                <li>The <s>&#60;s&gt;</s> renders the same as the insert tag, but is used for now-inaccurate content</li></ul>
