        <h2 id="What">Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm a sixth semester junior at the Fashion Institute of Technology. I study Advertising and Marketing Communications.<br>
        I grew up in Queens and went to a performing arts high school for instrumental music. I like fashion, and I love business, and I think I can really get ahead with knowledge of coding as well as best business practices.</p>

<!--About last semester-->
        <h2 id="Why">Why is coding important for me?</h2>
        <p>I find it really fun to code! I just don't know how to build anything from scratch, but I learned from last class that that's not necessary and that a lot of programmers actually work with things that are already built. In addition, when studying programming on my own, I found that the real work in this field is debugging, not building from scratch. So I find it important to learn proper syntax and how to properly find errors in code. On a less personal note, I work for an ecommerce company called <a href="http://bethmacri.com/" title="_blank">Beth Macri<a> that uses Liquid, a Ruby-based programming language, but it also has JavaScript assets as well as CSS and basic HTML. It's really fun to go into the code at work and know exactly what I'm changing and why it didn't work in the first place. Having solid programming skills can really put a person ahead in the job market.</p>

<!--Info about Brackets and extension-->
        <h2 id="text">About Brackets Beautify</h2>
        <p>I really like the Brackets Beautify extension because I can be quite a stickler for neatness, but it's hard to keep track of simple organization with coding because there's just... <i>so much</i>. Beautify helps me out!</p>
