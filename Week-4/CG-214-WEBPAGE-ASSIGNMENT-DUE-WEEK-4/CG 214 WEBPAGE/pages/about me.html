            <p>My name is Rocio Sanchez. I'm a 21 year old student and marketer from Queens, New York. I was born in NYC but I lived a lot of my life in Dominican Republic; my parents immigrated from there in the 80s.</p>
            
            <p>I went to Frank Sinatra School of the Performing Arts in Queens, New York from 2009 to 2013. I attended for instrumental music. I was very passionate about playing the flute. Now, not so much. But I won't forget how much that education helped develop me as a person.</p>
        
            <p>Now? I'm a sixth semester junior at the Fashion Institute of Technology. I study Advertising and Marketing Communications and minor in French. I anticipate graduating with my bachelor's degree in the winter of 2017. I'm entertaining the idea of getting my master's degree in Paris at L'&Eacute;cole Superieure de Publicit&eacute;, but I'll seriously consider that for a while. Money doesn't grow on trees, you know.</p>
            
            <p>I've been working at a jewelry company called <a href="bethmacri.com" title="beth macri">Beth Macri</a> since the beginning of summer 2016. The company is known for the Hidden Message Necklace. As an ecommerce marketer, one of my jobs is to make our website as accessible and easy to use as possible. This class will definitely help me in that aspect!</p>

        <h2 id="My web presence">My Web Presence</h2>
    
            <p>As a Advertising and Marketing Communications major, I've had to take a couple of internet courses to learn the ins-and-outs of SEO and simple content management.</p> 
        
            <p>In my Internet Marketing class (DM 435) I had to make a blog and do weekly assignments! My chosen topic to write about each week was about LGBT media. It was called "<a href="http://nuevayor.tumblr.com/tagged/lgbt masterlist project/" target="blank">The LGBT Masterlist Project</a>". As a member of the community I felt a personal responsibility to use my professional skills as a marketer and bring valuable content to my followers on my personal Tumblr blog.</p>
    
            <p>At the end of the project, I made a video to accompany the project. The point of the video was to add substance to my content, a face behind a project. It really helped get more followers behind me too!</p> 
        
            <p>Check it out:</p>

            <p>I find it really fun to code! I just don't know how to build anything from scratch, but I learned from the first CG 214 class that that's not necessary and that a lot of programmers actually work with things that are already built. Through this class I hope to gain a solid knowledge of web page construction, as my previous experience with coding was just playing aroud with the customizable HTML of my Tumblr blog.</p>
        
            <p>In addition, when studying programming on my own, I found that the real work in this field is debugging, not building from scratch. So I find it important to learn proper syntax and how to properly find errors in code. On a more professional note, I work for an ecommerce company called <a href="http://bethmacri.com/" target="_blank">Beth Macri</a> that uses Liquid, a Ruby-based programming language, but it also has JavaScript assets as well as CSS and basic HTML. It's really fun to go into the code at work and know exactly what I'm changing and why it didn't work in the first place. Having solid programming skills can really put a person ahead in the job market.</p>
